# DockerImpl

The provided Docker Compose file (docker-compose.yml) defines two services:

**postgres-app**: This service sets up a PostgreSQL database container using the official PostgreSQL Docker image (postgres:16.2). It exposes port 5432 to allow external connections to the PostgreSQL server. Environment variables are specified to configure the PostgreSQL instance, including the database name (POSTGRES_DB), username (POSTGRES_USER), and password (POSTGRES_PASSWORD). A volume (postgres-data) is mounted to persist the database data.

**my-app**: This service is defined with a build directive, indicating that it builds an image from the Dockerfile located in the current directory. You'll need to have a Dockerfile in the same directory for this to work. This service is currently not configured or defined further in the provided YAML file.

The .env file is used to set the required environment variables for PostgreSQL. It contains variables for the PostgreSQL password, username, database name, and port. These values are used by the PostgreSQL service in the Docker Compose file.

When you run docker-compose up --build, Docker Compose will start the PostgreSQL container using the specified configuration and environment variables. It will also attempt to build and run the custom application container (my-app), but since there is no Dockerfile or specific configuration for it, it will not perform any meaningful action for the my-app service.
